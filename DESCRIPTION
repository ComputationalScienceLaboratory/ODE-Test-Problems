Title: A MATLAB suite of initial value problems
Description: ODE Test Problems (OTP) is an object-oriented MATLAB/GNU Octave package offering a broad range of ordinary
 differential equations, partial differential equations, and differential algebraic equations which can be used to test
 numerical methods such as time-steppers and data assimilation methods. It contains problems that are linear and
 nonlinear, autonomous and nonautonomous, scalar and high-dimensional, and stiff and nonstiff. OTP also supports
 partitioned systems for testing IMEX methods, multirate methods, and other partitioned schemes. Many problems come from
 real-world applications in fields such as chemistry, astrophysics, meteorology, and electrical engineering. OTP's
 interface provides a simple and standardized way to access problem parameters, the right-hand side function, the
 Jacobian matrix, and other properties. Each problem is equipped with functions for computing the solution, plotting the
 solution, and creating a movie.
