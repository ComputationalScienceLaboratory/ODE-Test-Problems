# Building the Documentation

OTP uses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) and
[sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/matlabdomain) for documentation.

To install the necessary dependencies, run

```sh
make install
```

To build the site, run
```sh
make
```

You can launch the site locally with
```sh
make serve
```
